Title: The Battle of Jericho
Published Date: 2011-04-05
Description: Sixteen-year-old Jericho is awaiting initiation to the Warriors of Distinction, the oldest and most exclusive club in school—but how high a price will he have to pay to belong? Find out in this first novel in Sharon M. Draper’s Jericho Trilogy. When Jericho is invited to pledge for the Warriors of Distinction, he thinks his life can’t get any better. As the most exclusive club in school, the Warriors give the best parties, go out with the hottest girls, and great grades are a given. When Arielle, one of the finest girls in his class, starts coming on to him once the pledge announcements are made, Jericho is determined to do anything to become a member… But as the initiation week becomes progressively harrowing, Jericho is forced to make choices he’s not entirely comfortable with. And one member seems to have it in for the sole female pledge in the group…a pledge who will stop at nothing to show she can handle the pressure. But when is she being pushed too far, and when should Jericho and his friends step in and risk losing their places in the pledging process? As Jericho becomes increasingly uneasy, his cousin Joshua breezes through the initiation, never thinking of the consequences, even when the fine line between fun and games, and life and death is crossed.

Title: The Battle of Jericho
Published Date: 2020
Description: The Bible is the most widely read book in the world. It brings guidance and comfort to those who read it. A great many people believe in every word of the Bible. Yet, there are modern scholars who have dismissed parts of the Bible as a myth or simply a moral tale. They believe that the violent conquest of Canaan never happened, though it is described so vividly in the Book of Joshua and the following Books of the Bible. That the tribes of Israel settled peacefully in Canaan. They cannot reconcile a violent conquest with the date at which they believe that the Israelites entered the Promised Land. And so, they have dismissed parts of the Bible as being mere myth because it is inconvenient. I believe they have lost their way in interpreting the Bible. I have searched through the archaeological record and matched what I have found with the events described in the Bible. My book puts forward a plausible theory of how this pivotal battle unfolded. See if you agree with me. The Battle of Jericho, truth or myth.
